# Svelte for Meteor

Use [the magical disappearing UI framework](https://svelte.technology) with Meteor

## Installation

To use `meteor-svelte`, run `meteor add svelte:compiler` or add `svelte:compiler` manually to `.meteor/packages`.

> **Note**: `svelte:compiler` 1.46.1_1 is the last version that works with Meteor 1.5 and older.
> Later versions require at least Meteor 1.6.

By default, `svelte:compiler` compiles files with `.html` and `.svelte` extensions (`.html` is the official file extension for Svelte components).
If you want to use another package that processes HTML files in addition to `svelte:compiler`, e.g., `blaze-html-templates` or `static-html`, you can configure the extensions that the Svelte compiler is registered for by adding a `"svelte:compiler"` key to your app's `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "svelte:compiler": {
    "extensions": ["svelte"]
  }
}
```

## Additional features

* ES2015+ in Svelte components
* Source maps

## Top level head and body tags

You can use head and body tags as usual with `svelte:compiler` if the compiler is registered for file extensions that end with `.html`.
In this case, HTML files with top level head or body tags are not processed by the Svelte compiler.
Instead, the contents of the tags are added to the respective section in the HTML output generated by Meteor.
