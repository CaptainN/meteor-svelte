# meteor-svelte

Use [the magical disappearing UI framework](https://svelte.technology) in Meteor

## Installation

To use `meteor-svelte`, run `meteor add svelte:compiler` or add `svelte:compiler` manually to `.meteor/packages`.
Other packages that process HTML files, e.g., `blaze-html-templates` (the default for new Meteor projects) or `static-html`, have to be removed.

## Additional features

* ES2015+ in Svelte components
* Source maps

## Top level head and body tags

You can use head and body tags as usual.
HTML files with top level head or body tags are not processed by the Svelte compiler.
Instead, the contents of the tags are added to the respective section in the HTML output generated by Meteor.
